For my computer graphics class focused on shaders, we were tasked with creating a final project that can be anything of our choosing. I am particularly interested in perfecting realism with computer graphics. I love paying attention to small details and optimising whatever I can, so I chose to make a realistic fire shader. The creative process was really fun; I decided to showcase my project by using a Groudon obj model. For those who don't know, Groudon is a legendary ground type Pokemon. Groudon is mainly known for being associated with fire and lava so I decided to cover them with my fire shader.
