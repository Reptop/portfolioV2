This project is a website called Telltail that allows users to submit a picture of their cat or dog and receive a 92% accurate guess of the pet's breed. The website uses a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of cat and dog images to make predictions based on the submitted photos. I built this project with a group of other talented people using Vite and React for the frontend, and PyTorch, Python, Onnx, and FastAPI for the backend. The machine learning model was trained using PyTorch and then converted to Onnx for deployment. The backend is built using FastAPI, which allows for easy integration with the frontend. Overall, I am very happy with how this project turned out, espeicially with the accuracy of the model. It was a great experience working on a project that combines machine learning with web development, and I hope it can be a fun and useful tool for pet owners.
