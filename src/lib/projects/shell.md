This was my first real exposure to Unix system programming. I built a custom shell from scratch in C with support for piping, redirection, and background processes. The shell is called RKshell and it allows users to execute commands, create pipelines, redirect input and output, and run processes in the background. This project was a great learning experience for me as it required me to understand how the Unix operating system works and how to use system calls to implement the functionality of a shell. I am very happy with how this project turned out and I hope it can be a useful tool for anyone looking to learn more about Unix system programming.
