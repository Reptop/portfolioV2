### Context 
For my databases course, I was tasked with creating a database management system for a business of my choice. I chose to create a database for Pokemon card vendors, which I called PokeBase. The database structure was created in 2nd normal form with the goal of minimizing data redundancy and ensuring data integrity. The system was built using mySQL and Vite with a React frontend. 

### Backend
For the backend, I used mySQL procedures to implement the functionality of the database. I made the backend pretty simple by using a pool of connections to the database and exposing a few endpoints for the frontend to interact with. I hosted the backend on my university's Linux server. I also used a few mySQL features such as triggers and views to help with data integrity and to make it easier for the frontend to query the database. 

### Frontend
The frontend was built using React and Vite, and it allows vendors to easily manage their inventory and track sales. Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me as it allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in my databases course to a real-world project. 

### Results
The database allows vendors to easily manage their inventory and track sales. I am very happy with how this project turned out and I hope it can be a useful tool for Pokemon card vendors to manage their inventory and track their sale, even if this project is mostly a proof of concept. I 
hope to take the knowledge I learned from this project and apply it to future projects that I work on.
