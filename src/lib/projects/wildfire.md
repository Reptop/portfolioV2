For a hackathon, my team and I built a wildfire monitoring service called Catalytica using NASA FIRMS & AI. The service allows users to track fires, weather, and population impact through an interactive dashboard. The goal of the project was to empower communities with instant safety insights during wildfire events. We built the frontend using Vite and React, and the backend was powered by Firebase. We also integrated Google Gemini for AI capabilities to provide real-time insights and predictions based on the data from NASA FIRMS API. Overall, this project was a great experience working on a solution that combines data from NASA with AI to provide valuable information. This project also ended up winning the hackathon, which made me immensely proud of the work we did and the impact it could potentially have on communities affected by wildfires.
