For my computer graphics class, I was tasked with making anything I wanted. I have a fascination with spiders, so I decided to make a spider simulator. I animated and rendered a spider using OpenGL from scratch. Players control a spider to climb walls, strafe in any direction, and shoot lasers. I decided to prioritize functionality over realism, as a realistic spider would require model rigging; I just wanted this to be a fun and inviting tech demo.
