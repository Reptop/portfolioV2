This project is aimed to combat against the problem of pokemon card vending machines being scalped and resold for much higher prices. The website allows users to track pokemon vending machine stock levels in real time. Stock levels are reported by users and displayed on a map, allowing others to find nearby machines with the card set they want. I built this project using 
Svelte and SvelteKit. This was the first time I used Svelte and I really enjoyed it. The framework is very intuitive and easy to use, and it allowed me to quickly build a responsive and user-friendly website. I also used Leaflet for the map functionality, which was a great choice for this project. Overall, I am very happy with how this project turned out and I hope it can help Pokemon card collectors find the cards they want without having to pay scalpers.
