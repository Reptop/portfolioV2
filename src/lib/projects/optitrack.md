This is a project for a company called OptiTrack, which makes motion capture systems. The project is a quality control application that analyzes images to identify and grade relevant lens features, such as the circularity of markers and specific image characteristics. It also automates the lens focusing process, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy in motion capture setups. The app is built using Qt for the user interface, OpenCV for image processing, C++ for the core logic, and the OptiTrack SDK for integration with their motion capture systems. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for quality control in motion capture setups. Previously, this process was done manually, which was time-consuming and very vibe based. 
It was been a great experience to work on a project that has a real-world application and can make a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of motion capture setups. The project is still a work in progress, but I am excited to see how it will evolve and improve over time.
