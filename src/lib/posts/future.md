### Context 
I have been having some anxiety about my career and future overall. Recently, I applied 
as a software patent examiner. I did my first round of interviews and I am currently waiting to hear back about the next steps. I am really hoping to get this job, as it would be a great start for me to get any relevant software experience. If I don't get the job, I will continue with the Leetcode grind (oof). The current job market is not making things easier for, but I all we can do is stay positive and keep producing quality work. 

### Getting through the stress 
Exercise as been my main strategy in maintaining sanity during this stressful time. I have been going bouldering a lot, which is something I recommend to anyone regardless of their fitness level. I love pushing myself to try harder routes and understand how my body moves on the wall.

### Conclusion 
Basically, you need to stay locked in but also you need to nurture your mental health at the same time. I know it's easier said than done, but starting small and building from there is a good start.
